S1,
James,Hello there!
James,My name is James and I was 20 years old.
James,I followed my parents to country M since I was 6 years old.
James,"This year, I just graduated from university, and I am looking forward to what my future job will look like. "
Sam,"James! Get back to house ASAP, we need to talk about your future job. There are many things you need to know!"
James,"OK, mom :)"
S2,
James,"Hey mom, I will find my job by myself, don't worry about me."
Sam,"If you can find the jobs like other teens, I will not bother your decision."
Sam,"But as you know, we are not the same people like the people around us. We are immigrant."
James,So what? I have the confidence and ability to get a very good job. 
Sam,"This has nothing to do with ability and confidence. As you know, we are Asians and this is country M. They can distinguish each one by your color and face shape. "
Sam,"Some companies will not hire you because you are an Asian, or will never have a high-level position for you. "
S2.1,
James,"Really? But the law said everyone is the same, and we cannot racism other people."
Sam,"I know the law said racism is illegal, but they can using other reason to not hire you."
Sam,"Like, ""your skill is not fullfill all the ability"", or ""we need someone elder in this jobs""."
Sam,"If needed, they can find thousands of reasons to reject you. "
S2.2,
James,"I don't care about their opinions. I just need to keep doing my work, and they will find my value someday. "
Sam,You really look like your father. That's what he said when we just immigrated. 
Sam,"But he has been a salesman for ten years now, and I don¡¯t want you follow his path."
S3,
James,So what should I do? Mom. Can you give me some advice?
Sam,"It is best to find companies that are run by Asians, or companies that are more international. They don't care what race you are, they only value your abilities. "
Sam,You can start from the bottom and be careful not to be influenced by other people. 
James,"Alright mom, I will find my way to success."
Sam,"Be careful son. You know, the family will always accompany you. "
